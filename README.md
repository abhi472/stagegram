#A Kotlin-based Android App with MVVM Architecture and Offline-First Approach

##This application prioritizes a seamless user experience by leveraging a combination of modern development techniques:

#MVVM Architecture:
- Clean separation of concerns for maintainability and testing.

#Offline-First Approach:
- Prioritizes local data stored in a Room database, ensuring functionality even when offline.
- Network calls are made only when necessary, optimizing resource usage.

#Data Management:
- MainUseCase handles domain logic.
- MainRepository abstracts data access, promoting code reusability.

#Image Handling:
- Efficiently stores profile pictures using standard image formats due to their smaller size.
- Employs Coil for effective caching of story images, improving performance and user experience.

#Current Scope:
- Supports image formats exclusively for story content.

#Future Considerations:

##While the current implementation provides a strong foundation, there's room for further enhancements:
- Real-time Data Sync: Implementing an update service to subscribe to Firestore changes would keep the local database synchronized, offering a more up-to-date experience.
- Video Support: Expanding story content to include videos would diversify user expression and engagement.
- Accessibility: Ensuring the app caters to users with disabilities by adhering to accessibility best practices.
